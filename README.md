# SMS Spam Classification #
*Dataset- Quora similar question dataset*
## Description ##
This project focuses on developing a text classification model to differentiate between spam and ham messages. The text data is preprocessed using the NLTK package and vectorized using the SciKit package. tf-idf vectorization is applied to preprocess the text data. The model implements Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVC classifiers. Additionally, a stacked model is created, achieving an impressive accuracy of 98.65%.

## Key Features ##
